Functional models describe the external behavioral view (user＊s view) of the business system.
Structural models represent the objects and the relationship among them 每 static structure of the business system.
Behavioral models represent how the underlying objects in a problem domain collaborate together to support the use cases.


1. Three functional models (Functional models represent system＊s behavior)
	Business process identification 每 Use case diagram 
		Identify main business processes 每 use cases 
		Identify who performs these processes 每 users/actors
		Combine use cases with their actors in a diagram

	Business process modeling 每 Activity diagram
		Model how business processes (activities) work in the system
		Model movement of objects (data) across activities

	Business process documentation 每 Use case description (optional)
		Document use cases in details

2. Structural models (Structural models represent classes and their relationships within a system)
	Discover the key data contained in the problem domain and to build a structural model of the objects - Class diagrams

3. Behavior models (Focus is on the dynamic view of the system, not on how it is implemented)
	Illustrates the sequence of messages exchanged between objects in a use-case - Sequence diagrams
